Moodle Auto Download Remover
=====

Opens files in a new tab of the browser instead of downloading them
from moodle.

### Get the extension
If you use Firefox you can install the extension from
[here](https://spacegli.de/madr/latest.xpi).

Chromium browsers aren't supported.

### Todo:
- Maybe check files for mime types and only create a blob if the
  browser can open it. Right now these files still get downloaded, but
  without a progress bar and the filenames are lost.
