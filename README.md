Moodle Auto Download Remover
=====

Opens files in a new tab of the browser instead of downloading them
from moodle.

Todo:
- Maybe check files for mime types and only create a blob if the
  browser can open it. Right now these files still get downloaded, but
  without a progress bar and the filenames are lost.
